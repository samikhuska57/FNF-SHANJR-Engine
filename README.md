# **SHANJR (SHANJR)**  
*A Fork of Jordan Santiago’s Engine Focused on Performance and Fun*

## **Purpose**

SHANJR is a fork of **Jordan Santiago’s Engine (JS Engine)**, designed to:

- **Remove Botplay Lag**  
- **Lock a Stable 60 FPS**  
- **Run Shader-Heavy Mods Smoothly** (like Dave and Bambi or similar)  
- **Compete with H-Slice and JS Engine for Better Performance**  

_Originally, this wasn’t just for Dave and Bambi—but go ahead, use it for that if you want!_

## **Allowed & Not Allowed**

### ✅ **What You Can Do**

- Fork this engine freely (Jordan allows it!)  
- Modify the source however you like  
- Use it for your mods, experiments, and crazy projects  
- Test shader-heavy charts or high note counts

### ❌ **What You Shouldn’t Do**

- Don’t break the engine on purpose  
- If you fork it, **treat it like your own project**. Keep it alive.

## **Note Limit Warning**

⚠️ **ANJE isn’t optimized for 30k+ notes on screen (yet)**.  
We’re working on it—but **be reasonable with your charts**.

## **Compilation Info**

### **How to Compile**

SHANJR uses the `Main.yml` GitHub workflow to build.

- **Expect 2–3 hours to build** (depends on your hardware)  
- **Windows builds recommended!**

---

## **System Requirements**

- **Minimum:** 15–16 GB RAM  
- **If you’re insane:** 256 GB RAM = _no lag at all (probably overkill)_  
- **NASA PC?** It won’t lag.

## **Crazy Key Support**

We support **high keycounts**:

- **18 keys?** Easy  
- **26 keys?** Sure  
- **105 keys?** Possible  
- **500 keys?** If I’m crazy enough, I’ll do it
