1.48.1;

Additions:
- Changed "Load Autosave" to "Load Backup From File" which allows you to load not only autosaves, but chart files individually.
- Introduced TJSON support, currently for week JSONs, with potential for broader use. This is to assist those unfamiliar with JSON format.

Removals:
- Neo has been removed due to drama.

Fixes:
- Addressed an issue where notes were not despawning as expected, which should also improve input handling. (Hopefully)
- Fixed issues with broken health icon sizes. (I hope)
- Added support for icon metadata.
- Implemented animated health icons for enhanced visual feedback.
